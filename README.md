The purpose of this project aims for us to demonstrate all we know with foundational, 
    yet functional HTML, CSS, and JS. As a culmination project, it is imperative that
    we not only apply what we have learned, but also understand it.

Proper understanding of this project will create a solid foundation to build on top off.
    For this reason, I am truly excited.
