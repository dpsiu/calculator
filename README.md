The purpose of this project aims for us to demonstrate all we know with foundational, 
    yet functional HTML, CSS, and JS. As a culmination project, it is imperative that
    we not only apply what we have learned, but also understand it.

Proper understanding of this project will create a solid foundation to build on top off.
    For this reason, I am truly excited.

POST-PROJECT REFLECTION
This was an extreme stress of what I had learned so far. Lessons learned are - 
- Practice as much as possible before hand when doing projects
- Break down logic on paper/rubber duck
- Deep understanding of methods would have aided this project
Honestly, this felt rough. Although mentally taxing on a 
    capability and imposter-syndrome front, I was able to code efficiently. 
Big tasks that follow are remembering how I understood what I did in this project.
Understanding the methods, syntax, available tools, etc.
